# Dataproc-Cookbook

**Important:** For certain chapters, there are no standalone code files in this repository. In these cases, any code examples or blocks are provided directly within the chapter's content for your reference.

## How to Navigate This Repository

This repository is organized by chapter, with a dedicated folder for each chapter that contains custom code examples.

* **Chapter Folders:** Each folder named after a chapter (e.g., `Chapter_01_Introduction`, `Chapter_05_DataProcessing`) contains all the custom code snippets and projects discussed in that specific chapter.
* **No Folder, No External Code:** If a chapter does not have a corresponding folder in this repository, it means that chapter doesn't include any external code files. For these instances, please refer to the inline code blocks directly within the chapter's text in the book.
